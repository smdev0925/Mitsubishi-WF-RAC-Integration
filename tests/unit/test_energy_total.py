"""Unit tests for sensor.EnergyTotalSensor's accumulator.

The unit's own kWh counter is per run: it counts up while the indoor unit
runs, holds its value while the unit is off, and is cleared to 0 at the next
power-on. EnergyTotalSensor turns that into a lifetime figure by summing only
the upward steps. The sequences below are taken from a real two-day recorder
history of two units, resets included.

Only _update_state()/async_set_total() are exercised, on an instance built
without HA's entity machinery - both touch nothing but the four attributes
set up here.
